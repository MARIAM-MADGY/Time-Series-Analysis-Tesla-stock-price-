# 📈 Time Series Analysis – Tesla Stock Price
📌 Project Description

This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using Tesla’s stock price dataset.
The main goal is to analyze the time series, decompose it into components (trend, seasonality, residual), apply smoothing techniques, and build forecasting models.

🎯 Objectives

Plot and decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual.

Implement Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing techniques.

Build and evaluate ARIMA and SARIMAX forecasting models.

Measure model performance using RMSE.

Visualize actual vs. forecasted values.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

statsmodels

scikit-learn

📊 Results & Insights

Short-term forecasting: ARIMA and SARIMAX models perform similarly to the Naïve approach.

Multi-step forecasting: ARIMA significantly outperforms SARIMAX, achieving a lower RMSE.

Conclusion: ARIMA provides better forecasting accuracy for medium- and long-term predictions.
